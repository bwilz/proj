    <p class="btxt">I grew up in the Village of Birchwood, Wisconsin. I'm not offended if you haven't heard of it, and I am very impressed if you have. It is a place where the amount of bars equal the amount of churches and despite what you would imagine, there is always something to do. I left that humble home to attend college at UW-Stevens Point in 2008 where I proceeded to make my way into the fine arts program and study graphic design.<br/>
      <br/>During my final year at Point, my love life took an unexpected turn for the best when I met Benjamin Wilz at a friend's wedding. (I know, right? I didn't think that sort of thing happened in real life.) To boot he was the officiant, which made for a lot of confusion at the time. Kids and their newfangled ways of marrying people.<br/>
      <br/>We proceeded to dance the night away, and though we didn't speak much, there was definitely a sense of knowing between us. Two years later and we are living in Madison and writing sappy copy for our wedding website! Go on, I know you appreciate it.<br/>
      <br/>To conclude, I want to thank our beautiful family for all of the support over the years and giving me such a happy life. I am so excited to share our wedding day with you, and I really hope to see you in Baraboo!
